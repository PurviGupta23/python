A string upGrad string if the frequency of its characters is something like 1, 2, 3, 4, .... That is a character appears only once, another appears twice, another appears thrice and so on. For example string '$yrr$ssrsr' is a upGrad string since the frequency of y:1, $:2, s:3, r:4, however string '$yrr$ssrsr%' will not be an upGrad string since it has two characters (y and %) with frequency 1.
